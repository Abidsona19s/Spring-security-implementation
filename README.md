# Spring-security-implementation
Project is present inside the feature branch.
I used spring security in testing project.
Security related things are present into the com.test.security package.
I worked on role based authentication.
I am getting Stuck
Firstly I will Explain one by one 
If role is Admin so Admin can Access everything and working as you can see inside the configurations class.
but if you are user and access only our details that time through error 403 access denied but that error should not come because already
I given authority to the user you can access this particular endpoint.this is my issue.
Please check it where is my mistake.
